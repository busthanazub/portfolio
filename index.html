        <h2>Career Journey</h2>
        <div><h3>1988–1992: Television and film debut</h3>
            <img src="https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2022/oct/SRK-BTS-BH-Deewana_d.jpg" width="430px" height="400px" alt="">
        <p>Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[37] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[38][39] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992).[40] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[40] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[41] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[42] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[40][43</p></div>

        <h3>1993–1994: Anti-hero</h3>
        <img src="https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2018/11/13/bazigar.jpg"  width="430px" height="400px"  alt="">
        <p>Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[52] Baazigar, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[53] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero".[54] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[55] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero".[55] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences.[56] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he "walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role".[57] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[58] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[59] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.</p>

        <h3>1995–1998: Romantic roles</h3>
        <img src="https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shah-Rukh-Khan.jpg"  width="430px" height="400px"  alt="">
        <p>Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[62] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a "romantic hero".[63] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an "all time blockbuster" by Box Office India,[62][64] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[65][66] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[67][68] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards.[55] The director and critic Raja Sen said, "Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.</p>

        <h3>1999–2003: Career fluctuations</h3>
        <img src="https://e0.pxfuel.com/wallpapers/878/19/desktop-wallpaper-shahrukh-kabhi-khushi-kabhie-gham.jpg"  width="430px" height="400px"  alt="">
        <p>Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[85] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[58] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[86] The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[87] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[88] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying "Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little."[89] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[90] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan.[91][92] On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, "Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance."</p>

      <div><h3>2004–2009: Comeback</h3>

    <p>2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[113] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[114] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[115] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million)</p></div>

    <div><h3>2010–2014: My Name Is Khan and expansion to action and comedy</h3>

    <p>After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[143] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a "symbol of assertive rasa values" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[144] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[145][146] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[106][101] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[49] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[147] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with "averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts", believing it to have been a "standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval"</p></div>

        <h3>2015–present: Career setbacks, hiatus and resurgence</h3>

        <p>Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom.[199][200] Grossing over ₹10 billion (US$130 million), it emerged as the highest-grossing film of Khan's career and Hindi cinema's second-biggest grosser.[201] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[202] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that "Khan’s screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor".[203] Jawan set further opening weekend records for a Hindi film, overtaking Pathaan</p>
